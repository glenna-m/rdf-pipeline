Sorry, installation and configuration documentation have not yet been written.   Contact david@dbooth.org directly if you wish to try out this software.

= RDF limitations in pipeline.ttl =
The RDF Pipeline Framework expects pipeline.ttl to obey certain conventions and limitations:
  * pipeline.ttl must be written in Turtle.
  * Blank nodes should only be used implicitly, and only when specifying a list, such as as a list of a node's inputs:
{{{
:foo a p:FileNode ;
  p:inputs ( :bar1 :bar2 :bar3 ) .
}}}

= Inputs: p:inputs =
A node's inputs are listed using the p:inputs predicate:
{{{
:foo1 a p:FileNode ;
  p:inputs ( :bar1 :bar2 :bar3 ) .

:foo2 a p:FileNode ;
  p:inputs ( :bar1 ) .
}}}

A node with no inputs (or p:dependsOn's, discussed below) will be run only once (to initially freshen its state), and thereafter never again unless caches are flushed using tools/flush-caches or the updater itself is changed, because each node's updater is an implicit dependency:
{{{
# No inputs
:foo1 a p:FileNode .
}}}

== File inputs ==

File inputs may be specified as inputs in three ways:
{{{
# Input file is $DOCUMENT_ROOT/node/bar.txt (because that's where pipeline.ttl is):
:foo1 a p:FileNode ;
  p:inputs ( <bar.txt> ) .

# Input file is $DOCUMENT_ROOT/node/bar.txt :
:foo2 a p:FileNode ;
  p:inputs ( "bar.txt" ) .

# Input file is $DOCUMENT_ROOT/node/bar.txt :
:foo3 a p:FileNode ;
  p:inputs ( <http://localhost/node/bar.txt> ) .

# Absolute path: input file is /home/dbooth/bar.txt :
:foo4 a p:FileNode ;
  p:inputs ( <file:///home/dbooth/bar.txt> ) .
}}}

*WARNING:* Because of the one-second resolution of Last-Modified headers, if a file changes more than once within the same second, changes after the first may not be detected.  See https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42987

= Non-input dependencies: p:dependsOn =
Sometimes it is useful to indicate that a node depends on some other node or external source or file without actually requiring that thing's output.  This can be indicated using p:dependsOn .  For example, a node could depend on a clock source, which would cause the node's updater to run every time the node's output is requested (assuming the clock source has changed every time):
{{{
foo: a FileNode ;
  p:inputs ( :bar1 :bar2 :bar3 ) .
  p:dependsOn ( <http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/> ) .
}}}
