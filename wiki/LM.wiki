#summary LM - High-resolution last-modified time

= Introduction =
HTTP 1.1 defines a Last-Modified header, but its resolution is one second.  Thus, it cannot be used to detect changes that happen at a faster rate.  The ETag header can be used to indicate such changes, but it does not necessarily carry time information.  

To address this, the RDF Pipeline framework uses a high-resolution timestamp known as an "LM" to indicate the last modified time.  An LM is relative to each node -- not global -- because nodes hosted on different servers will not generally have synchronized clocks.

For easy comparison, an LM is a decimal number represented as a fixed-length string, such as:
{{{
  1328113669.123456000001
}}}

The number before the decimal point is the number of seconds since the epoch (on that node's host).  The digits after the decimal point nominally represent fractional seconds, however: (a) the precise times are not necessarily significant (i.e., they are only used for uniqueness); and (b) the last 6 decimal places are actually generated from a counter maintained on the node's host, to ensure that no two LMs are ever generated by two separate calls of GenerateNewLM() on that host are the same, provided that the node's host clock is monotonic.

An LM is transmitted via HTTP in ETag and If-None-Match headers.  In such transmission, the string "LM" is prepended to the LM, so that the recipient can detect the fact that it is an encoded LM:
{{{
  ETag: "LM1328113669.123456000001"
  If-None-Match: "LM1328113669.123456000001"
}}}
