Node Metadata Properties
========================
Most of these are node properties, though some (noted) are node type properties.
Perhaps we should standardize internal naming, something like:
  fooPath	-- A filename full path.
  fooDir	-- A directory full path.
  fooUri	-- A URI.
  fooName	-- A native name (i.e., node-type specific).

a	hash	Inverse is {member}
out	value	Native name of node output
outOriginal	value	Value of out predicate before setting defaults
outUri	value	URI of out (used as key for LM)
command
contentType	value	HTTP Content-Type for this node's serialized output.  Defaults to defaultContentType of the $nodeType if not specified.
cache
date
defaultContentType	value	Subject is $nodeType.  Default HTTP Content-Type for serialized output.
dependsOn	list/hash	URIs of inputs, parameters and anything else this node depends on.
dependsOnName	hash	Maps a dependsOn URI to the native name for that input.  I.e., points to local "cache".
dependsOnSerName	hash	Maps a dependsOn URI to the local file name for that serialized input.  I.e., points to local "serCache".
dependsOnNameUri	hash	Maps a dependsOn URI to the URI corresponding to dependsOnName. (Used as key for saving LM.)
dependsOnSerNameUri	hash	Maps a dependsOn URI to the URI corresponding to dependsOnSerName. (Used as key for saving LM.)
fOutExists	value	Subject is $nodeType.  Function that returns 1 iff the given out or local cache exists.
fSetNodeDefaults	value	Subject is $nodeType.  @@ Is this used? @@
fSerializer	value	Subject is $nodeType.
fDeserializer	value	Subject is $nodeType.
fRunUpdater	value	Subject is $nodeType.
fUpdatePolicy	value	Update policy function for this node.
fUriToNativeName	value	Subject is $nodeType.  Converts a URI to a native name.
inputNames list	Native input names for this node.
inputs	list/hash	URIs of this node's inputs.
lmFile	value	File name of node's last modified timestamps: (output and all inputs)
member	hash	Inverse of rdf:type (aka "a")
Node
nodeType	value	Most specific node type -- a leaf class.
outputs	hash	URIs of this node's outputs.  Derived from inputs & parameters.
parameterNames list	Native parameter names for this node.
parameters	list/hash	URIs of this node's parameters.
rdfs:subClassOf	hash	Inverse is subClass
nodeHost	hash	Subject is $nodeType.  Maps the server prefix (such as "http://localhost/") of node URIs of that $nodeType to the root location (as native name) of the server that implements the wrapper for for that $nodeType.  Analogous to $DOCUMENT_ROOT.  
# Obsolete?
# scope	value	URI prefix without trailing "/".  Env = scope + node type
# scopePath	value	File path corresponding to scope (under DOCUMENT_ROOT)
serOut	value	File name of serialized out (under DOCUMENT_ROOT).  Same as out if the node has no fSerializer.
serOutUri	value	URI of serOut
serCache	value	File name of cache of serialized out.
stderr	value	File name of stderr from last update.
subClass	hash	Inverse of rdfs:subClassOf
updater	value	Native name of updater function
