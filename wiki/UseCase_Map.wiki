#summary Use case: Map

This use case motivates the need for map capability.  A patient record contains prescription information that includes SIG strings.  A SIG string is an abbreviated description of the drug, dosage, instructions for taking it, etc., that has been prescribed to the patient.  In transforming the patient record, each SIG string for a prescription instance must be parse and transformed into the target model.  Each patient record may have many prescription instances, each one having one SIG string.  A java program reads one SIG string as a command-line argument, and one prescription instance ID, and writes an RDF graph corresponding to that SIG string (but expressed in the target model).

There are a few challenges with this use case:
  * There are many patient records -- each one should be one map instance.
  * There are many prescription instances within each patient record -- each one should be one map instance.
