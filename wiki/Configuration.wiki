#summary Configuring the RDF Pipeline Framework

WARNING: This page is `very` incomplete.  It is starting to collect installation and configuration notes, but is nowhere near being ready for someone else to follow smoothly.

= Introduction =

This section will describe installation/configuration information for the RDF Pipeline Framework.

= Installation =
 * cwm (this will be changed the Perl Trine library when we get a chance)
 * apache2
 * mod_perl2

= Configuration =
See trunk/apache2-config/ReadMe.txt .

= Debug level =

Debug information is written to the apache2 error log, {{{/var/log/apache2/error.log}}} on Ubuntu 10.04.  The {{{$RDF_PIPELINE_DEBUG}}} environment variable controls the amount of debugging detail, and must be set using the {{{PerlSetEnv}}} directive in the apache2 configuration file such as {{{/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default}}}:
{{{
<Location /node/>
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlSetEnv RDF_PIPELINE_DEBUG $DEBUG_CHANGES
      PerlResponseHandler  RDF::Pipeline
</Location>
}}}
Debug levels start from 0 (debugging off, only warnings and errors are logged) and go up from there.  Look at the RDF::Pipeline source code to see what the levels mean.
